# Contributing

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to this library! We welcome any
type of pull request, issues and comments! ðŸ˜€

For pull requests, make sure you:

* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style (4 space indent)
* Run the `clean` script before submitting a Pull Request
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

If you are interested in working on something, those tasks generally
fall into two categories.

If the task you want to work on is a large task or a new task,
that is a task not recorded and prioritized in our [Issues List](/issues.md),
please [create an issue](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues),
explain the change you want to make, and include why you believe that change
is needed or is important.

If you are not sure of what task you want to do and you just want to help,
take a look at our [Issues List](/issues.md) and see if anything grabs your
attention.  If not, contact us and we can have a conversation about how you
can best contribute.
